## Programming Assignment

In this exercise you will practice basic linear programming and solve a more advanced mixed integers programming question.

I have used cvxopt library to solve, and networkx library to draw graphical solution.

1.	Warmup: solve the question in the link below using your linear programming chosen library:

2.	Use integer linear programming to solve the graph coliring problem. Draw 3 solved graphs with at least 10 nodes and 11 edges, as in the right figure:

ilp.ipynb contains the documentation for the mixed integers solver, you may also search it online.
