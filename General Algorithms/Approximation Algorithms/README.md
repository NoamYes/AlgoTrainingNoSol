## Approximation Algorithms

Read chapter 35.

Answer the next questions:

After 35.1: Read about clique in a graph and complementary graph. Suppose you had an algorithm for finding a minimum vertex
cover in a given graph in time T(n). Explain how you could use this algorithm to find a maximum clique in a given graph 
(over n vertices) in time O(T(n)+poly(n)). Hint: Complementary graph.
