# PCA

Read pages 559-570 in Bishop book – first part on PCA, and more in the internet ofcourse :) 

In this exercise you will implement PCA on a given faces images dataset.

Only numpy,cv2 libraries are allowed. Matplotlib only to visualize results.
 
np.linalg – to calculate distances, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

1.	Present 5 most dominant eigenfaces spreading the data (“ghost images”)

2.	Build a classifier using the PCA decomposition. This classifier receives an image of 1 person and outputs the index of the most-probable person among n different persons. Present average classification accuracy over 2<=n<=10 different image pairs. In each pair, one image is for "training" and the other for validation.
