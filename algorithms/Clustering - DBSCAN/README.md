# Clustering - DBSCAN

Read about the DBSCAN algorithm:

https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/ch8.pdf pages 526-555

You will implement a variation of this algorithm to detect outliers.

Data.csv contains x (first column), y (second column) and class (third column):

1.	Present the data with different colors for different classes

2.	Apply dbscan algorithm on the data, present outliers in red and all other clusters in blue.

Read the next paper:

3.	Implement the two algorithms presented and apply p-dbscan to find outliers now. Choose your parameters to present meaningful differences from the regular dbscan results.
