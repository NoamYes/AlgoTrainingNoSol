# Clustering - DBSCAN

Read about the algorithm:

http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-cluster-plot-dbscan-py

https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-overview-of-outlier-detection-techniques-1e0b2c19e561 

Specifically, about dbscan algorithm.

You will implement a variation of this algorithm and understand better outlier detection.

Data.csv contains x (first column), y (second column) and class (third column):

1.	Present the data with different colors for different classes

2.	Apply dbscan algorithm on the data, present outliers in red and all other clusters in blue.

Read the next paper:

3.	Implement the two algorithms presented and apply p-dbscan to find outliers now. Choose your parameters to present meaningful differences from the regular dbscan results.
