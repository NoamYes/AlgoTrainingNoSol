# Clustering based methods for semantic segmentation
References: K-means – Bishop and https://github.com/suhas-nithyanand/Image-Segmentation-using-K-Means. github_for_comparison folder to compare results.

Agglomerative clustering – Wikipedia and https://chrisalbon.com/machine_learning/clustering/agglomerative_clustering/ <br/>
Apply semantic segmentation on the star image, try to separate it from background:<br/>
1.	K - means (It is not hard to implement, if you struggle use sklearn)<br/>
2.	Agglomerative clustering (there are multiple ways to solve issues you might encounter)<br/>
For each method use the next features:<br/>
•	Color only<br/>
•	Color and distance
