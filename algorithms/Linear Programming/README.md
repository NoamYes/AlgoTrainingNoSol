# LP and MIP
In this exercise you will practice basic linear programming and solve a more advanced mixed integers programming question.

I have used cvxopt library to solve, and networkx library to draw graphical solution.

1.	Warmup: solve the question in the link below using your linear programming chosen library:

2.	Draw 3 solved graphs with at least 10 nodes and 11 edges, as in the right figure:
