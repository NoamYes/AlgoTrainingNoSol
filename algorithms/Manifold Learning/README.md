# Manifold Learning – Non Linear Dimension Reduction

Read about the next non linear methods from the following references:

Isomap: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/courses/AP06/presentations/ThompsonDimensionalityReduction.pdf 

        https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~aghodsib/courses/f06stat890/readings/tutorial_stat890.pdf

TSNE: https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/

Use the next methods to perform dimension reduction on one of the persons in the data folder:

•	PCA

•	MDS

•	Isomap

•	TSNE

Show some of the faces on the plot to better visualize the dimension reduction. Choose the neighbors numbers wisely.
