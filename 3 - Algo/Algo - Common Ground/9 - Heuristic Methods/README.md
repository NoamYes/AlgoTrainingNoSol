# Heuristic Methods

Read in AIMA chapter 4 up to 4.2 (not including).

Watch the youtube video "Mona Lisa approximated with 150 circles through hill climbing genetic algorithm"

You will now implement the solution yourself with some additions :)

Use 100 circles for approximations, and solve using three methods:

1. Hill Climbing (or one variation of it)

2. Simulated Annealing

3. Genetic Algorithm

You should submit a report covering your solution, having the structure:

Problem description

Methods description (no more than 3-4 sentences per method)

Emprical results (approximated images, convergence graph per method, comparison graphs between different methods and same method using different hyperparameters)

Explanation of the findings
