Initially - Ask your supervisor to run the initialization script.

1. go the problems -> desired problem
2. inside the python file you have formalization of the problem
3. under the formalization there is an empty method, fill it with your solution.
4. when you think the solution is ready, test it with CheckSolution file from the utils package.
5. keep amending your solution until you pass all tests! don't give up :)

Good Luck!

Tip - no exercise demands you of massive coding (our school solution is always shorter than 30 lines of code).
Don't be quick to write your solution, be smart!
