# Greedy Algorithms

Read in IA p.414-421, p.423-427.


Answer questions:

IA p.447 - 16-2. Start easily :) 

IA p.446 - 16-1. (Extra question - find a criteria on the set of coin values defining if the greedy algorithm is optimal)


Perform the following programming exercises:

- closest pairs
- double bit switch
