## Genetic Algorithms

# Assignment

read abount the Traveling Salesmam Problem in IA p.1096-1097
We will try to create an approximated solution to the TSP using genetic algorithm.
you have 10 datasets containing 2D cities coordinated, every couple of cities is connected by a road (whose length
is the distance between the cities).
start with dataset_1.csv and try to achieve the best result you can. afterwards, proceed to the next datasets (that
contains more cities).

note that in info.csv file you have, for each dataset:
1. the amount of cities it contains.
2. the optimal output can be achieved in this dastasets.

compare you results to the optimal output.
