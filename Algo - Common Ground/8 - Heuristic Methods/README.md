# Heuristic Methods

Read in Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach chapter 4 up to 4.2 (not including).

Watch the youtube video "Mona Lisa approximated with 150 circles through hill climbing genetic algorithm"

You will now implement the solution yourself with some additions :)

Use 100 circles for approximations, and solve using three methods:

1. Hill Climbing

2. Simulated Annealing

3. Genetic Algorithm

Attach images of approximated images, and graphs you deem relevant, comparing the different solutions.
