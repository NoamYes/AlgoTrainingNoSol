For DS guy - Parallel to doing this and team topics, perform the three research reports.

For Algo guy - Parallel to doing this, perform one research report.

# Guide

This training relies on several books:

(1) An Introduction to Statistical Learning.

(2) The Elements of Statistical Learning.

We refer to (1) as ISLR and to (2) as ESLI during the training.
