# Clustering based methods for semantic segmentation

Read about K-means and Agglomerative clustering from https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/ch8.pdf

Read about cluster evaluation from the same chapter

Perform image compression on the star image using the next algorithms:<br/>
1.	K - means (Implement yourself)<br/>
2.	Agglomerative clustering (there are multiple ways to solve issues you might encounter)<br/>
For each method use the next features:<br/>
•	Color only<br/>
•	Color and distance

3. Use 2 different cluster evaluation methods to evaluate your clusters
