Read about K-means in ISLR 386-390 

Read about Agglomerative clustering from ISLR 390-398<br/>
Apply semantic segmentation on the star image, try to separate it from background:<br/>
1.	K - means (It is not hard to implement, if you struggle use sklearn)<br/>
2.	Agglomerative clustering (there are multiple ways to solve issues you might encounter)<br/>
For each method use the next features:<br/>
•	Color only<br/>
•	Color and distance
