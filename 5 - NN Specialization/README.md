# Deep Neural Network

## Theoretical part of general networks:

### Introduction to Neurons

(The exercises are attached to each week.)

### Introduction to Pytorch

## Other general networks:

### Theoretical part - RNN

Read the next post by head of AI of Tesla, which gives a list of rules to build and practice neurons networks:

### Practical part - RNN

The next kaggle challenge describes measurements of 8 motion sensors (acceleration meters) of a robot moving on campus on several surfaces:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/career-con-2019

The idea is that the data from sensors can help to understand the nature of the surfaces for the classification mission.

The exercise is interesting because it is a TS problem, and there is a relatively large number of dimensions  for the problem.

Of course, you are expected to try rnn, but it is important to try some types, and to understand the meaning of the changes.

It is also necessary to read the description of the problem on the website, and to experience the  information carefully, it hides non - trivial things that can improve the results.

As with any challenge, summarize the various stages (Aksploratia, production of features, comparing different models and conclusions)
