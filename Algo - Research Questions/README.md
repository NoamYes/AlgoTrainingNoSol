# Research Questions

Choose one non-trivail problems from the next topics:

1. Computational Geometry

2. Theoretical Graph Problems

3. SNA (focus on graphical network analysis topics)

For that problem, prepare a research report answering the next questions:

* What is the input? what is the output? summarize the problem.

* Research the topic and explain different solutions to the problem:
  
    Compare memory, running time, accuracy...

    Compare different modelings.

* Research different python libraries used to solve this problem 

* Solve a toy example if time allows.

* Include reference to articles / books

* You may use the relevant books in the sources


Now present your findings to the team - 

* 30-minutes presentation

* Present the topic / problem

* Motivation for the chosen solution

* Keep it clean and coherent
