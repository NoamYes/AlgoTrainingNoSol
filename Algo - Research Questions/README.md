# Research Questions

Choose 3 types of problems from the following list:

1. Computational Geometry

2. Graph Problems: Polynomial-Time

3. Combinatorial Problems

4. Graph Problems: Hard Problems

For each type - look for a problem of your choosing in ADM algorithms catalog.

For that problem, prepare a research report answering the next questions:

* What is the input? what is the output? summarize the problem.

* Research the topic and explain 3 different solutions to the problem:
  
  Compare memory, running time, accuracy...
  
  Compare different modelings.

* Research different python libraries used in the civil world to solve those.

** Include reference to articles and discuss
